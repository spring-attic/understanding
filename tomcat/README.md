# Understanding Tomcat

[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) technologies. Tomcat is flexible in that it allows third-party [view technologies][u-view-templates], hence it does not restrict you to JSPs.

Tomcat is developed in an open and participatory environment that is governed by the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/). It is released under the [Apache License version 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). 

Tomcat powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations.

Tomcat can be either downloaded and installed, or it can be used by embedding it into your application as a simple library, as is the typical use by a [Spring Boot application][gs-spring-boot].
