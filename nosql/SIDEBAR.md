- [Spring Data Couchbase](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/spring-data-couchbase)
- [Spring Data FuzzyDB](https://github.com/whirlwind-match/fuzzydb-spring/)

Each of these projects provides a simplified API to interact with their relevant data stores. They also employ a commonly shared [Spring Data Commons](https://www.springsource.org/spring-data/commons) to make it possible to write basic **save()**, **delete()**, **update()**, and **findXxxYyyZzz()** methods which automatically generate queries. This can provide a developer with a lot of data needs.

When a more customized query is needed, `@Query("<query string>")` can be used to annotate the method, allowing the developer to write a query in the data store's query language.
